          <summary>What is Relationship Battery?</summary>
          <p>Relationship Battery is a simple online service to help you check how your relationship is doing. You fill out
            a short questionnaire, and then a trained therapist helps you understand your results and offers support
            sessions if needed.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who can use Relationship Battery?</summary>
          <p>Anyone in a relationship can use it—individuals, couples, families, or even work teams. It works for new
            relationships, married couples, or groups who want to improve how they connect and communicate.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does the process work?</summary>
          <p>You start by filling out our online questionnaire. Your answers are reviewed by a therapist. Then, sessions are
            set up based on your needs—these could be just for you, with your partner, or with your whole group.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is my information confidential?</summary>
          <p>Yes! Everything you share is private. Only you and your assigned therapist can see your responses.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How long does it take to fill out the questionnaire?</summary>
          <p>Most people finish in less than 10 minutes. It’s designed to be quick and easy.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What happens after I submit my answers?</summary>
          <p>A therapist will look at your responses and use them to understand your relationship "battery"—your current
            connection, strengths, and any concerns. They will then contact you to set up sessions or share your results.
          </p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What kind of sessions do you offer?</summary>
          <p>
            <strong>Individuals:</strong> Two private sessions to talk about your results and next steps.<br>
            <strong>Couples:</strong> Each person fills the form alone, then each gets one individual session and you both
            join two sessions together.<br>
            <strong>Groups/Teams:</strong> Every member fills the form. Each gets an individual session if needed, and then
            you meet together for group sessions.
          </p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can both partners fill out the questionnaire together?</summary>
          <p>No, each person should fill it out separately and honestly. This gives a clearer picture and helps your
            therapist help you better.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can groups or families use Relationship Battery?</summary>
          <p>Yes! Groups like families, housemates, or teams at work can all use it. Each person completes the form, and
            group sessions are arranged based on everyone’s answers.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Will I get advice or a score after I submit?</summary>
          <p>After you submit, your therapist will review your answers and reach out with feedback or to arrange a session.
            You can ask for a written summary if you like.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who are the therapists?</summary>
          <p>All our therapists are trained professionals with experience in counseling individuals, couples, and groups.
            You will be matched with someone best suited to your needs.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
          <p>The first check-in and feedback are free. If you choose to have therapy sessions, we will share the cost
            details with you before you begin.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What if I need more help after my sessions?</summary>
          <p>You can always book more sessions or ask for ongoing support. We are here for you as long as you need us.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I get support in an emergency?</summary>
          <p>Relationship Battery is not for emergencies. If you are in crisis or need urgent help, please contact local
            emergency services or a crisis helpline.</p>
